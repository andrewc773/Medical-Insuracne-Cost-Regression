# Medical-Insuracne-Cost-Regression
Linear Regression model created to predict medical insurance cost

This project's intent is to create a multiple linear regression model using SKLearn. Given several features such as Age, BMI, Sex, and Smoker status, the model predicts the medical insurance cost of an individual with the input for them being values representing the respective features. 

This project improved my understanding of regression evaluation metrics, how to handle categorical data in a regression model, multicollinearity and measuring it using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), and familiarity with Pandas and SKLearn.
